</div>
		<div><
</div>
		<div>1942-1967</div>
		<div>>
</div>
		<div>Although the NHL was formed in 1917 these six teams nicknamed “The Original Six” were the only NHL teams from 1942-1967. The six teams were the Montreal Canadians Est. 1917, the Boston Bruins Est. 1924, the Chicago Blackhawks Est. 1926, the New York Rangers Est. 1926, the Toronto Maple Leafs Est. 1927 (formerly the Toronto St. Pats Est. 1919), the Detriot Red Wings Est. 1932 (formerly the Detriot Falcons Est. 1930).</div>
		<div>1967-1970</div>
		<div>The 1967 NHL Expansion</div>
		<div>Number of Teams added:
6
</div>
		<div>In 1967 the number of NHL teams doubled when it expanded to tweleve teams. The six teams added in 1967 were the Philidelphia Flyers, the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Los Angeles Kings, the St. Louis Blues, the Minnesota North Stars and the Califonia Seals who changed their name to the Oakland Seals midway through their inaugural season. 
</div>
		<div>Current Number of  Teams:
12
</div>
		<div>The 1970 NHL Expansion</div>
		<div>1970-1972</div>
		<div>Current Number of  Teams:
14
</div>
		<div>In 1970 the NHL expands again. This time two more teams are added and the total number of teams is now fourteen. The two teams added in 1970 were the Buffalo Sabres and the Vancouver Canucks. In addition to the two expansion teams the Oakland Seals franchise changed their name again. Starting in 1970 the Seals went by the California Golden Seals.
</div>
		<div>Number of Teams added:
2
</div>
		<div>1972-1974</div>
		<div>The 1972 NHL Expansion</div>
		<div>Current Number of  Teams:
16
</div>
		<div>Just as they did two years prior the NHL added two more teams in the 1972 expansion. One of the two teams added in 1972 was the New York Islanders. Based in Long Island the Islanders join the Rangers as the second New York NHL team. The other team added in 1972 expansion was the Atlanta Flames. The Flames are legendary franchise, but their time in Atlanta will be short lived.
</div>
		<div>The 1974 NHL Expansion</div>
		<div>The NHL continued its theme of adding two teams every two years again in 1974. One of the two teams added in 1974 was the Washington Capitals who just won thier first Stanely Cup in the 2017-2018 season. The other team added in 1974 was the Kansas City Scouts who ended up being one of the shortest lived teams in NHL history.
</div>
		<div>Current Number of  Teams:
18
</div>
		<div>1976-1979</div>
		<div>Number of Teams Merged:

</div>
		<div>Current Number of  Teams:

</div>
		<div>Number of Teams Relocated:
2
</div>
		<div>1976 Relocations & 1978 Merger</div>
		<div>The NHL saw two different teams relocate in 1976. First, the Kansas City Scouts Est. 1974 relocated to Colorado and became the Colorado Rockies. The other team that relocated was the California Golden Seals Est. 1970. The Golden Seals relocated to Clevland and became the Clevland Barons. Like the Scouts the Barons were also short lived as the team merged with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978.
</div>
		<div>The 1979 NHL expansion was the most unsuccessful expansion in NHL history. There were four teams that were added to the NHL in 1979 and only one of those four teams is still around today. The only team to survive til this day is the Edmonton Oilers. The three other teams added were the Hartford Whalers, the Quebec Nordiques and the original Winnipeg Jets franchise. All three of those teams were relocated by 1997.
</div>
		<div>The 1979 NHL Expansion</div>

		<div>1979-1980</div>
		<div>Number of Teams added:
4
</div>
		<div>1980 The Atlanta Flames Relocate
</div>
		<div>In 1980 the NHL saw another relocation as the Atlanta Flames move to Calgary. They decided to keep the keep the Flames name and they became the Calagry Flames. During their time in Atlanta the Flames made it to the playoffs six out of their eight years in the league, but failed to make it to the Stanley Cup. Since the relocation Calgary has made it to the playoffs twenty-three times, including each of their first eleven years in Calgary. Their sole Stanley Cup came in the 1988-1989 season.
</div>
		<div>Number of Teams relocated:
1
</div>
		<div>1980-1982</div>
		<div>The Colorado Rockies Est. 1976 (formerly the Kansas City Scouts Est. 1974) franchise moves again 1982. This time they relocated to New Jersey and became the New Jersey Devils. The struggling franchise had made it to the playoffs just once between their time in Kansas City and Colorado. They found much more success in New Jersey making the playoffs twenty-two times, reaching the Stanley cup five times and winning the cup in the 1994-1995, 1999-2000 and 2002-2003 seasons.
</div>
		<div>1982 The Colorado Rockies Relocate
</div>
		<div>1982-1991</div>
		<div>The 1991 NHL Expansion
</div>
		<div>Number of Teams added:
1
</div>
		<div>Current Number of  Teams:
22
</div>
		<div>1991-1992</div>
		<div>In 1991 the NHL had its first expansion since 1979. This time the NHL only added one team because they had had an odd number of teams ever since the Clevland Barons merged with the Minnesota North Starts back in 1978. The sole team added in 1991 was the San Jose Sharks. This made it so Califonia had two NHL teams again after the Golden Seals had relocated to Cleveland in 1976. The Sharks have made the playoffs twenty-one of their twenty-seven seasons with no Stanley Cups.
</div>
		<div>1992-1993</div>
		<div>The 1992 NHL Expansion
</div>
		<div>For the first time the NHL had an expansion for back to back years. In 1992 the NHL added two more teams bringing the total number of teams to twenty-four. One of the two teams added was Ottawa Senators, who was origanally a franchise from 1917 to 1934. The other team added was the Tampa Bay Lighting giving Florida their first NHL franchise. The Senators have reached one Stanley Cup, but lost to the Ducks. The Lightning have reached the cup twice, defeating the Flames in the 2003-2004 season.
</div>
		<div>Current Number of  Teams:
24
</div>
		<div>The 1993 NHL expansion saw two more teams added to the league giving the league a total of twenty-six teams. One of the teams added in 1993 was the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (who would change their name to the Anaheim Ducks in 2006). The other team added was the Florida Panthers, which gave Florida a second NHL team along with Tampa. Along with the expansion the NHL also saw the Minnesota North Stars Est. 1967 relocate to Dallas to become the Dallas Stars in 1993.

		<div>The 1993 NHL Expansion & Minnesota Relocation
</div>
		<div>1993-1995</div>
		<div>The Demise of the 1979 Expansion
</div>
		<div>From 1995 through 1998 the NHL saw three of the four teams added in 1979 expansion relocate. First in 1995, the Quebec Nordiques relocated to Colorado and became the Colorado Avalanche. This is the second time Colorado got an NHL franchise. Then in 1996, the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Arizona and became the Pheonix Coyotes (they changed their name to the Arizona Coyotes in 2014). Finally in 1997, the Hartford Whalers relocated to Raleigh and became the Carolina Hurricanes.

</div>
		<div>The 1998 & 1999 NHL Expansions
</div>
		<div>1998-2000</div>
		<div>For back to back years in 1998 and 1999 the NHL would add a new team. The 1998 NHL expansion brought us the Nashville Predators. The Predators have reached the playoffs twelve times and the Stanley Cup once losing to the Penguins in the 2016-2017 season. In 1999 the NHL returned to Atlanta with the Atlanta Thrashers. The Thrashers saw much less success than Atlanta’s original franchise the Flames as they only made the playoffs once before being relocated in 2011.
</div>
		<div>Current Number of  Teams:
28
</div>
		<div>Current Number of  Teams:
30
</div>
		<div>The 2000 NHL draft brought two more teams to the NHL made the team total an even thirty. One of the teams added in the 2000 expansion was the Columbus Blue Jackets. The 2000 expansion also brought hockey back to the State of Hockey. Seven years after the Minnesota North Stars relocated to Dallas the Minnesota Wild became the NHL's thirtieth team. Columbus has made the playoffs five times, while the Wild have made it nine times. Neither team has reached the Stanley Cup Finals.
</div>

</div>
		<div>2000-2011</div>
		<div>2011 Atlanta Relocates… Again
</div>
		<div>In 2011, after a very unsuccessful twelve years with only one playoff appearance, Atlanta lost it’s second NHL team. First the Flames relocated to Calgary in 1980. This time the Atlanta Thrashers would relocate to Winnipeg. The original Winnipeg Jets franchise relocated to Pheonix in 1996. After fifteen years without a team, in 2011, Winnipeg would get their team back or at least their team’s name. Since the relocation, this new iteration of the Jets have made the playoffs three times.  
</div>
		<div>2011-2017</div>
		<div>Current Number of  Teams:
31
</div>
		<div>2017-Today</div>
		<div>In 2017 the NHL added it’s thirty-first team the Vegas Golden Knights. The Knights would go on to make it to the Stanley Cup Finals in their very first season in the NHL. So far they have reached the playoffs in each of their first two years in the NHL. The NHL has also announced its plan to have another expansion team in the 2021-2022 season to make it an even thirty-two teams. The 2021 season will bring the NHL to Seattle, however the team’s name and logo still remain unknown.
